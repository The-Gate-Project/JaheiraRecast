<h1>Jaheira Recast</h1>

<p>A BG:SoD/EET mod by AstroBryGuy</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Heidi Shannon (the original voice of Jaheira) was unreachable for Siege of Dragonspear and Beamdog originally cast a new voice actor in the role. Eventually, they decided the new actor was not working out, and left Jaheira's lines unvoiced and her original BG1 soundset. However, many of Jaheira's voiced lines and almost all of her soundset are included in the SoD files. This mod reconnects those files to the dialog lines and gives Jaheira's soundset an SoD update like the other returning NPCs.</p>

<h2>Components</h2>

<h3>Jaheira Recast: Character Sounds - Use new SoD Character Sounds</h3>

<p>This component gives Jaheira her planned soundset for SoD. Almost all the files for the soundset are available, except the REACT<em>TO</em>DIE<em>GENERAL and REACT</em>TO<em>DIE</em>SPECIFIC sounds. The former is left blank and for the latter, another appropriate voiced line has been used.</p>

<h3>Jaheira Recast: Character Sounds - Use BG1+BG2 Character Sounds</h3>

<p>This component keeps Jaheira's original BG1 soundset, but supplements it with BG2 sounds for character sound not present in the BG1 soundset (e.g., the "SPELL_FAILED" sound).</p>

<h3>Jaheira Recast: Dialog Voiceover</h3>

<p>This component adds the available voiced lines to Jaheira's dialogs. There are about 70 lines of voiced dialog in the SoD files.</p>

<p>Note: it is not required to install the Character Sounds component in order to install the Dialog Voiceover component. You can have original BG1 character sounds and new SoD voiced dialog.</p>

<h3>Jaheira Recast: Give Jaheira her BG2 Portrait</h3>

<p>This component will replace Jaheira's portrait with her BG2 portrait for BGEE and SoD.</p>
